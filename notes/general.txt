MySQL Migrations:
- First, drop all old tables that might be in MySQL with ' DROP TABLE threads; '
- ' python manage.py db upgrade ' will create the tables
- ' python manage.py db migrate ' when changes are made to models and need to upgrade the version, and redo all these steps to make changes to database 
    (confirm this with Yusuf or just by testing it)


Save all dependencies:
- ' pip freeze > requirements.txt '

To install later if needed:
- ' pip install -r requirements.txt '
